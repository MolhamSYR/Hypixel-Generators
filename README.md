# Hypixel-Generators
This adds Hypixel-like Generators to the game with the floating block on top

If You Want To Use This Plugin.. All What You Have To Do To Setup a Generator:

1. Make Your Minecraft Character Look At The Block That You Want It To Become a Generator.
2. Do The Command (It Needs to Have OP Permission): /generator set <The-Material-You-Want> <Cooldown-Between-Actions>. 
 Note: (At The Cooldown Argument, You Should Insert [Seconds * 20] Because Every 20 tick is a real life second).
3. Have Fun :D ! If You Want To Remove the generator you look at the block that is producing the materials and do the command /generator remove
